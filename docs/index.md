# Welcome to RadiantOne Cloud Native Lab

A complete guide to run RadiantOne platform in docker and kubernetes.

This lab is divided into four sections:

* [Docker](./docker.md)
* [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.md)
* [Kubernetes](kubernetes.md)
* [Helm](helm.md)

Commands from each section can be copied and run directly. Some optional steps can be skipped.
